    <h1>Web Devlopment</h1>
    <P>Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications. This involves a combination of 
        different technologies and programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create web pages and
         make them interactive.
        Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development and back-end development. Front-end development deals with the visual aspects of a website or application, including the design, layout, and user interface. This involves
         working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that can be viewed in a browser.</P>
